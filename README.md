PGXN::Client
=============

This was to be a command-line interface for finding, downloading, building,
and installing [PGXN](http://pgxn.org/) extension distributions writtn in
Perl. But then [Daniele Varrazzo](https://github.com/dvarrazzo) beat wrote one
in Python. So this project is defunct. What you want is his
[pgxnclient](https://github.com/dvarrazzo/pgxnclient) project. It's even
better than what I would have done.
